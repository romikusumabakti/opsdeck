# OpsDeck

A self-hosted operations panel for managing servers, projects, databases, and
internal knowledge from a single control plane. Built as a whitelabel app
(`NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME` overrides the "OpsDeck" branding), it lets a small team
provision databases, run backups, control services, and keep documentation —
all over SSH against your own infrastructure.

## Features

- **Servers** — register hosts and run operations over SSH (`node-ssh`).
- **Projects & tasks** — group infrastructure work; long-running operations are
  tracked as tasks with live status and streamed logs.
- **Databases** — create, rename, and drop databases on PostgreSQL and SQL
  Server, plus backup and restore (including cross-database file relocation).
- **Services** — control `docker`, `systemd`, and `kubernetes` services.
- **Knowledge base** — collections of rich-text documents (Tiptap) with
  full-text search, revisions, internal linking, image attachments (Garage
  object storage), breadcrumbs, and a scroll-spy table of contents.
- **Auth & teams** — email/password via [better-auth](https://better-auth.com),
  `admin`/`member` roles, invitations, and optional email-domain whitelisting.
- **Background jobs** — durable operations run through self-hosted
  [Inngest](https://www.inngest.com/) (backups, restores, service control,
  database lifecycle).
- **Internationalization** — `en`, `id`, `ar`, `zh` via `next-intl`.
- **Email** — transactional mail via [Resend](https://resend.com) + React Email
  (optional; disabled when unconfigured).

## Getting started

Requirements: **Node ≥ 24**, **pnpm**, and a **PostgreSQL** instance.

```bash
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env   # then fill in the values below
pnpm db:migrate        # apply schema migrations
pnpm dev               # http://localhost:3000
```

On first run, open the app and complete the `/setup` flow to create the initial
admin account.

## Docker

`compose.yaml` brings up the full stack — app, PostgreSQL, Valkey, a
self-hosted Inngest server, and a Garage object store. Set the required secrets
in `.env`, then:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

Inngest runs in production mode and needs a dedicated `inngest` database
(`INNGEST_POSTGRES_URI`), separate from the app's own database. App functions
are registered via Inngest sync after the stack is up.

### Object storage setup (Garage)

Knowledge-base image attachments are stored in [Garage](https://garagehq.deuxfleurs.fr/)
(S3-compatible, self-hosted). After the stack is up, provision the layout,
bucket, and access key **once**:

```bash
# 1. Assign storage to the single node and apply the layout
docker compose exec garage /garage layout assign -z dc1 -c 10G $(docker compose exec garage /garage status | awk 'NR==3{print $1}')
docker compose exec garage /garage layout apply --version 1

# 2. Create the bucket (must match S3_BUCKET)
docker compose exec garage /garage bucket create knowledge

# 3. Create an access key and grant it read/write on the bucket
docker compose exec garage /garage key create app-key      # prints Key ID + Secret
docker compose exec garage /garage bucket allow --read --write knowledge --key app-key
```

Copy the printed **Key ID** / **Secret** into `S3_ACCESS_KEY` / `S3_SECRET_KEY`
in `.env`, then restart the app (`docker compose up -d app`). Uploads are
re-encoded to WebP (EXIF stripped) and served back through the auth-gated
`/api/knowledge/asset/<id>` route — the bucket stays private.

## Project layout

```
actions/      Server actions (servers, databases, backups, services, tasks, knowledge, …)
app/          Next.js App Router — [locale] pages + /api routes
components/    UI components (shadcn / Radix-based)
inngest/      Background job client + functions
lib/          Core libs — db, auth, ssh, email, branding, validation
drizzle/      Migrations + generated artifacts
messages/     i18n message catalogs (ar/en/id/zh)
tests/        Vitest tests
```
